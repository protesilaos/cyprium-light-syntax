# Cyprium syntax theme (light variant)

A low-contrast theme inspired by the landscapes of Cyprus as they appear during the transition from spring to summer.

Yellow is the most prevalent accent, followed by orange, and green.

Cyprium comes in both light and dark variants while using the same palette.

## Acknowledgement

The actual code structure is adapted from Simurai's excellent [DuoTone syntax theme](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax). Contrary to DuoTone, Cyprium uses a 16-colour palette hence the need for adjustments.
